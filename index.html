                <h2>My Experience</h2>
                <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have actively engaged in various organizational roles that have been instrumental in developing my skills in management, financial oversight, and event planning.
                    At Himpunan Mahasiswa Sistem Informasi Unsika in Karawang, Indonesia, I served from January 2023 to December 2023 as a member of the Business and Relations Division. In this role,
                    I was responsible for managing the division’s finances as the treasurer and overseeing the implementation of the "Business Company" program. I successfully executed this program over 
                    two batches, generating a profit of IDR 4,500,000 by selling a variety of Information Systems merchandise to both Unsika students and the general public. My proactive approach and dedication
                    were recognized when I was awarded "Staff of the Month" for May, honoring my exceptional initiative and contributions to the division.</p>
                <p>During my involvement with the Study Club Front End and UI/UX Himsika from May 2023 to November 2023, I was a member of the Events Division.
                    My responsibilities included designing and organizing the event structure to enhance member participation. I played a crucial role in developing
                    a well-structured program that not only met but exceeded member expectations. As the timekeeper for each meeting, I ensured that events ran smoothly
                    and adhered to the scheduled agenda. My efforts in organizing the technical aspects of the Study Club contributed to the successful execution of the
                    program across two batches, significantly improving the overall participant experience.</p>
                <p>In my role with the Academic Achievement Support Himsika from April 2023 to November 2023, I served as the Budget Implementer. I was responsible for creating an efficient budget plan for the
                    Academic Achievement Support activities. I managed a budget of IDR 1,374,000, ensuring that all financial resources were allocated effectively to meet the event’s requirements. My duties
                    also involved coordinating with various divisions to address and fulfill the financial needs of the activities, demonstrating my ability to manage resources strategically and collaborate
                    effectively with different teams.</p>
                <p>Lastly, as the Executive Secretary for the Musyawarah Anggota IV Himsika in December 2023, I played a pivotal role in preparing and organizing key documents for the event.
                    This included drafting the proposal and accountability report, managing all necessary correspondence, and meticulously recording minutes of each meeting. My attention to
                    detail and organizational skills were crucial in ensuring the event’s success and maintaining accurate and comprehensive records.
                    These diverse experiences have significantly enhanced my abilities in organizational management, financial oversight, and event planning.
                    I am enthusiastic about applying these skills and further developing them in my future endeavors.</p>
